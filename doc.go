Package heupr is a machine learning-powered platform to automate project management for software teams
working on GitHub. Our goal is to work towards building features and services that allow
developers and managers to stay in the "[flow zone](https://firstround.com/review/track-and-facilitate-your-engineers-flow-states-in-this-simple-way/)"
and do what they do best: write code!

"Heupr" is a portmanteau of the words "heuristic" and "projects" and is pronounced "hew-Per."
