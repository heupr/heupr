// This will include the conflation/normalization logic as well as Scenario3 from the old code
// The process will be "first child" prioritized
// Only build the logic as it relates to issues specifically
// There will also need to be a way for these different normalization process to be called in the newRepo bootstrapping as per the parsed settings information (e.g. the proper setup for information before its fed into its respective model)
// Add a field onto the logic/ structs (which need to be built) to hold normalize.Normalizer interface values for interchangeable functionality
