# Code of Conduct

> How we do things at Heupr :bulb:

## Pledge

We, the maintainers of the **Heupr** project, will work to build a productive and constructive environment for all of our contributors and collaborators.

## Standards

We hold our members to three core tenants - _creativity_: bringing the ideas of the individual to the world, _humility_: placing faith in the knowledge of others, _generosity_: giving openly to those around you. Our philosophy centers on _creativity_, _humility_, and _generosity_. Be constructive, collegial, open, and honest. Let's build cool stuff together. :beers:

## Responsibilities

The maintainers hold the responsibility to clarify acceptable behavior while working on the Heupr project and contributors may report inappropriate content or interactions to heuprHQ@gmail.com. Also, the maintainers retain the right to remove content and to ban contributors if deemed necessary as a result of inappropriate behavior.
