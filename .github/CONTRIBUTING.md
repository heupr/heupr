## Process

Welcome to the team! We like to keep our process simple so we follow a typical open source [Git](https://xkcd.com/1597/) workflow.

- [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) you want to make a contribution to
- Make your changes and update unit tests if necessary
- Commit the code updates in your local repo
- Push the updates out to your remote fork
- Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)! :raised_hands:

## Requirements

We like to keep things organized so here are the requirements for getting your contribution merged.

- Check the Issue and Pull Request templates for specifics on content
- Commit messages should follow [these guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) (the "seven rules")
- Code should adhere to [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) and [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) requirements
- For Go code, stick to these [general guidelines](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Add and update unit tests for submitted changes
- The CI pipeline should pass all tests
- Feel free to use emojis to add some color! :art:

Last step!
