## Description

This repository primarily serves as a canvas for sketching out architectural designs for the Heupr platform. Additionally, this repository may eventually be built up to a functional service but for now it will be an idea playground. Head over to **[`heupr/core`](https://github.com/heupr/core)** for the working service.
