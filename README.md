## Introduction

Heupr is a machine learning-powered platform to automate project management for software teams working on GitHub. Our goal is to work towards building features and services that allow developers and managers to stay in the "[flow zone](https://firstround.com/review/track-and-facilitate-your-engineers-flow-states-in-this-simple-way/)" and do what they do best: write code!

"Heupr" is a portmanteau of the words "heuristic" and "projects" and is pronounced "hew-Per."

## Description

This section is currently **WIP** but will be updated with package documentation and installation/usage instructions in the near future.

## Contributing

Here are a few quick points to help get you started:

- We follow test-driven development (TDD) on this project so be sure to build test cases alongside the production code; [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/heupr/heupr) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/heupr/heupr) will ensure that they are run and that our coverage is adequate but feel free to run them locally too!
- Our overall design goal is to be as "plug-n-play" as possible so that different modules (frontend and backend) can be introduced by different users; keep everything _modular_ and _minimal_!
- All of our code should be [clean and readable](https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code) so be sure to run `gofmt` and `golint` on your code - this is also checked by Travis-CI just to be safe!

We're excited to have you working with us!
